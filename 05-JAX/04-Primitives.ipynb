    "\n",
    "JAX offers a series of composable function transformations like JIT compilation, auto-differentiation, auto-vectorization, and more. In order to carry out these transformations, JAX needs to know about the \"structure\" of the function being transformed. For instance, take the case of autodiff: JAX needs to know, somehow, which mathematical operations are being applied to each input parameter in order to be able to compute its derivative analitically. This evokes an idea of an abstract representation of the function, like a *computation graph*, that relates inputs and operations to the outputs of the function. The operations in this computation graph are called **Primitives** and they will be the main object of study in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next logical question is: how do we obtain such computation graph? If JAX was part of the Python interpreter, it could simply get a reference of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the function and make transformations based on it. However, JAX is distributed as a library therefore it needs another mechanism of obtaining the computation graph: **tracing**. The tracing mechanism consists of calling the function to be transformed with special objects in place of the inputs. These special objects overload the mathematical operations in Python and a able to \"record\" everything that is done to them. This record of operatins is precisely what we a looking for: a computation graph. In JAX terms, this computation graph is calleda JAXPR, short for *JAX Expression*. The special objects used in place of the real parameters are called Tracers. We will talk more about them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next cell shows an extremely simplified example of tracing a function by overloading binary operators. The class `AbstractVar` represents an abstract variable: it has a name but its not have a value; the class `Expression` represents a recursive structure of computations performed on abstract variables; and the class `Tracer` manages to create the structure of expressions for us."

In other words, the function being transformed should produce its output based solely on its inputs and not depend on any external implicit value (*e.g.* global variables, files, etc). Another way to put it is to say that functions must be *free of side-effects*.\n",
